# Extremum-Seeking-Control-Mass-Spring-Damper-System
## This is a work done with the help of Res. Asst. Berkem VURAL
This work on Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) for a mass-spring-damper system includes a theoretical background, a Simulink example, a mathematical model, and a live script for controller comparison. It covers system dynamics, PI regulator control, and ESC application, enabling comprehensive controller comparisons via simulation.
